    </p>
    <p>Anyone can make a Pesto Pasta, but not everyone knows how to make a pesto pasta that’s slick with plenty of pesto sauce without adding tons of extra oil! Here’s how I make it.</p>
    <p>Try this with homemade pesto. It’s amazing!</p>

    <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pasta</li>
            <li>Chicken</li>
            <li>Seasonings</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Parmesan</li>
            <li>Sun dried tomatoes</li>
            <li>Pesto</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Season the chicken. Cut 1 pound of boneless, skinless chicken breasts into 1-inch pieces and add to a large mixing bowl. Next, season the chicken with 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning and a big pinch each of kosher salt and black pepper. Toss to coat.</li>
            <li>Cook the pasta. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil and salt it well with about 1 tablespoon of salt. Drop the pasta in the boiling water and cook until al dente according to package instructions (about 8 to 9 minutes).</li>
            <li>Cook the chicken. While the pasta is cooking, add the olive oil to a large non-stick pan and heat over medium-high. Add the chicken and cook, tossing occasionally, until golden brown on the outside and cooked through, about 7 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta. When the pasta is ready, reserve about 1 cup of the cooking water and drain.</li>
            <li>Combine. To the pan with the chicken, lower the heat and stir in the cooked pasta, ½ cup of heavy cream, ¼ cup of parmesan, and ¼ cup of sun dried tomatoes. Stir until everything is well combined. If it looks a bit dry, add a splash of the pasta cooking water (a couple of tablespoons at a time) until the pasta is glossy and coated in the creamy sauce.</li>
            <li>Add the pesto. Turn off the heat and take the pan off the burner. Stir in ½ cup of basil pesto. Finish with a sprinkle of grated parmesan, red pepper flakes to taste, and some torn fresh basil leaves. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
